The parties have designated London as the jurisdiction for any litigation arising in connection herewith.

                <h3>Forward-looking Information</h3>

                <p>This website includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may", "will", “expect”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “foresee”, “believe” or “continue” or the negatives of these terms or variations thereon or similar terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements require CEPHEUS to make assumptions and are subject to important known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause CEPHEUS’s actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. While CEPHEUS considers its assumptions to be reasonable and appropriate based on current information available, there is a risk that they may not be accurate.</p>

                <p>Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include risks associated with general economic conditions, risks associated with CEPHEUS’s business environment (such as the financial condition of the industry, government policies and priorities and competition from other businesses), operational risks (such as regulatory risks and dependence on key personnel, risks associated with doing business with partners, risks involved with developing new products and services, warranty and casualty claim losses, legal risks from legal proceedings, risks relating to the Corporation’s dependence on certain key customers and key suppliers, risks resulting from fixed term commitments, human resource risk and environmental risk), financing risks (such as risks resulting from reliance on government support, risks relating to financing support provided on behalf of certain customers, risks relating to liquidity and access to capital markets, risks relating to the terms of certain restrictive debt covenants and market risks, including currency, interest rate and commodity pricing risk). For more details see the heading entitled “Risks and Uncertainties” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of CEPHEUS’s Annual Report.</p>

                <p>Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future growth, results and performance is not exhaustive and undue reliance should not be placed thereon.</p>

                <p>The forward-looking statements set forth herein reflect CEPHEUS’s expectations as at the date hereof and are subject to change after such date.</p> Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, CEPHEUS expressly disclaims any intention, and assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
